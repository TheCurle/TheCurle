thecurle@github:~$ cat aboutme.txt
Hi! I'm Curle.

I'm from Wales, i work on way too many projects, i have way too much not enough free time, and I hate linux.
(ironic, right?)

thecurle@github:~$ cat projects.txt
My most notable projects are probably:
- <a href="https://github.com/MinecraftForge">Minecraft Forge</a>, the open-source modding API.
- <a href="https://github.com/TheCurle/Purpuri">Purpuri</a>, a Java 7 JVM in C++ written from scratch
- <a href="https://github.com/TheCurle/Chroma">Chroma</a>, an amd64 OS in C++ written from scratch

Aside from those, i have a stack of other side-projects that you'll find scattered across the internet.

thecurle@github:~$ cat sysadmin.txt
You may notice from the layout of this README that i've copy-pasted an ssh session.
Systems administration is sometimes a necessary evil.

On that note, i host the <a href="https://forge.gemwire.uk">Forge Community Wiki</a> and a bunch of other things, but most of them are currently down for maintenance.

thecurle@github:~$ cat closing.txt
If you've read this far, i'm surprised. Have a fun fact:

Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness.
